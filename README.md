# NARDS
Devils Invent - Fall '22

## Getting Started

Welcome to NARD's Attendance System project. To simplify the onboarding process I've decided not to use any build tools for this project.
Dependencies will be included as part of the content of this repository in the /lib/ directory.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
